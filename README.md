# Sophie's README

I find it takes at least 6 months of working with someone to learn their preferred communication style, what stresses them out, what motivates them, and what they value most. The goal of this README is speed up and democratize that process for folks working with me.

## The TL;DR

* I love working, but I love not working more. I value my personal relationships and hobbies above anything else.
* I find that the strongest and most fulfilling work comes from collaboration.
* I am an introvert and need quiet time for recharging and thinking.
* I am even-keeled and do not often get angry or overly excited.
* I have a tendency to over-commit myself.
* I am motivated by recognition and praise. I wish I didn’t have an ego, but I am human and I do.
* I am on a journey to being a better manager, coworker, ally, and person. I try not to lean on others to do this work for me, but welcome feedback when I fall short.

## What I expect from my team

**Be communicative.**

Ask questions. Share work early. Leave a paper trail behind your work. Write documentation. Speak up if you don’t agree with something. Ask more questions.

**Be thoughtful.**

Think through all possibilities. Don’t overlook details. Don’t do anything lazily. Realize the impact of the work you’re doing.

**Be proactive.**

Don’t wait to be asked to do something. Seek out answers to your questions. Find clarity in the undefined. Look many steps ahead. 

**Be helpful.** 

Look for ways to make things better for those around you. Support and encourage your coworkers. Use your experiences and priviledges to lift others up.

**Be dependable.** 

Do what you say you will do. Be on time for meetings. Don't miss deadlines. Speak up as soon as you think you might not be able to.


## What they can expect from me

**I will lead by example.**

All of the things I expect from my team, I expect from myself too. I hold myself to the same standard. 

**I will provide clarity.**

You should know what to be working on and have an idea of how your work applies to wider company goals. I will be decisive when you come to me with questions or need feedback. I will be clear and consistent in how I communicate. 

**I will be honest.** 

I will give you direct, timely, and actionable feedback. I promise to answer any question or concern that you come to me with as best I can, even if it means saying “I don’t know.” If I don’t know, I will do my best to find an answer. 

**I will be available.** 

I will reply to Slack messages, emails, and meeting requests as quickly as I can (during reasonable hours!). I won’t miss or cancel our weekly 1:1s. I will prioritize design feedback and code reviews. I will be present and ready to help you do your best work.

**I will cultivate an inclusive and healthy environment.** 

I want to create an environment where people feel comfortable to push themselves, despite the risk of failing. I will bring my whole (sometimes messy) self to work. I will take time off when I need it and prioritize my own self care. I will continue to educate myself on how I can be a better ally to marginalized folks. I will admit when I'm wrong.


## How I work with my direct reports

### Meetings
* Every week we will have a 30-minute 1:1. This is an opportunity to discuss existential life things, career growth, active projects, or to just shoot the shit. What we do with that time is up to you. I ask that you fill out the [1:1 issue template](https://github.com/sophshep/manager-resources/blob/master/1-1-issue-template.md) ahead of time to help us make the most of the time.
* On Mondays, we have a cross-functional team meeting to check in, discuss what we’re working on, share work, and overcome any blockers.
* I may sit in on project-meetings that you’re involved in so that I can be looped-in and know how best to support you.
* The team has semi-regular, ad-hoc design reviews. I put these on the calendar when we have work to share that can benefit from informal feedback from other designers. These reviews are casual and supportive.

### Communication
* I hate being micromanaged and assume everyone on my team feels the same way. I trust that if you have questions or are going to be late with work, then you’ll speak up. For this reason, I don’t like to check in with you too often. If you prefer a more involved leadership style, let me know and we can put structures in place to make sure you are supported.
* I consider writing to be the most important design skill. This is especially important since we work remotely and asynchronously. I value written communication and appreciate when thought has been put into ensuring that it’s in the right medium (Slack/GitHub/e-mail/Google Docs).

### Feedback
* I give positive or constructive feedback in real time, and am conscious of where I am leaving it. Nothing in formal reviews should be a surprise.
* I love receiving feedback about my own performance, but realize that it can be awkward to give it. Please feel free to speak directly to my manager, your coworkers, or even HR if you think there is something I can be doing to improve.
* I am a big believer in Lara Hogan's [feedback equation](https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/).
